__Assignment Description:__
<br/>
Task: Given an directed graph with possibly negative edge weights and with 𝑛 vertices and 𝑚 edges, check
whether it contains a cycle of negative weight.
<br/>
<br/>
Input Format: A graph is given in the standard format.
<br/>
<br/>
Constraints: 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 103, 0 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 104, edge weights are integers of absolute value at most 103.
<br/>
<br/>
Output Format: Output 1 if the graph contains a cycle of negative weight and 0 otherwise.

If you're currently taking the same course, please refrain yourself from checking out this solution as it will be against Coursera's Honor Code and won’t do you any good. Plus, once you're worked your heart out and was able to solve a particularly difficult problem, a sense of confidence you gained from such experience is priceless :)"
